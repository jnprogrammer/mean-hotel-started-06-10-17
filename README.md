Build barebones project that will be the foundation for the MEAN hotel

Update 06-26-17
    Currently I've had multiple issues dealing with my NPM install and mongodb set up. I neglected the easier route of using mean.io to obtain a deep understanding on how npm and mongodb work on a linux enviorment. 

    Because of this, I've taken a considerable amount of time, more than I expected. Also I've become very comfortable with linux installations on a vm and installing various applications through the terminal, I've read up on how linux commands work and what they mean when I use them in various contexts. 
 
    I currently comfortably use zshell over bourne again shell. I've learned why zsh was made and who made borne again shell. I've also replaced vi with sublime text to keep my workflow consistently fast. 

    My current install of linux is Lubuntu, its light weight design has won my heart for running smoothly on my laptop over ubuntu. Before starting this project I wasn't comfortable nor proficient with linux development as I am today. I am a bourne again developer.

    Mongodb has presented many issues that I didn't understand at first, but because I kept at it I now have mongod and mongo shell working with ease, I read up on Optimistic concurrency control and WiredTiger just a bit even though it didn't have anything to do with my isses. 

    My issues with mongo was that I was that I didn't follow the steps on the documentation page on mongodb.com. I also didn't set up the /data/db path correctly giving the correct persmissions to my account to allow mongo to work from there.  I've installed mongo 10 times on 10 different VM installs of linux. 

    My issues with NPM are not as serious now. I've opened dialog with NPM.org and they are helping me work though my ignorance of the technology.
